  Description:
    Abstract: The roads layer was digitized from USDMA 1:100,000 scale.  The layer includes 3 type of roads, all weather primary, all weather secondary and tracks.
    Purpose: Road layers provide basemap data on road and track features at a 1:100,000 scale. Users must assume responsibility in determining the usability of this data for their purpose. Not for use in scales greater than 1:100,000.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: This layer was digitized by United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and later on was updated at AIMS based on United States Defense Mapping Agency (USDMA) 1:100,000 scale and Russian 1:50,000 scale topo maps. In the class field, there are three classes; 1 = all weather primary, 2 = all weather secondary, 3 = tracks.  For more details regarding the process steps please refer to USAID office.
